proc_data.json,"Based on the provided JSON log data, the activity appears to involve the repeated creation, renaming, and memory mapping of files located in the directory:"," ``` /Users/mac_malware_research/Library/Biome/streams/restricted/App.InFocus/local/732644426276090 ```  Additionally, there are many instances of the process:  ``` /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/BiomeStreams.framework/Support/BiomeAgent ```  which is signed by Apple (""com.apple.BiomeAgent"") and appears to be a legitimate Apple component. However, the suspicious activity involves:  - Multiple file creations and renames in ""Biome/streams/restricted"" and related temp directories. - Repeated memory mappings (mmap) of files in ""Biome/streams/restricted/App.InFocus/local/..."". - The consistent use of the same signing ID and executable path, which suggests this process is repeatedly doing similar operations.  While the process itself is from an Apple-supported binary, the context of frequent creation and renaming of files within ""restricted"" directories, especially in combination with repeated mmap operations into temp and cache directories, might indicate malicious activity or exploitation, especially if these are unexpected for the process which normally wouldn't perform such file manipulations (additional context needed).  **Important note:** The process is signed and from Apple, which reduces suspicion but doesn't eliminate potential compromise if an attacker has implanted malicious code within a legitimate binary or is exploiting it.  **Suspicious findings summary:**  - Repeated creation, renaming, and mmap of files in restricted directories associated with ""BiomeAgent"". - Extensive activity in directories related to ""Biome/streams/restricted"", which could be used as hiding or staging areas by malware. - Continuous activity on temp and cache files, common for malware to use for persistence or staging.  ---  **Action:** Investigation should focus on why ""BiomeAgent"" or related processes are accessing restricted paths and performing these file operations. This could be legitimate behavior under certain conditions, but combined with unusual activity, it warrants further examination.  ---  **Note:** Since the activity is within an Apple system process (BiomeStreams), this may in some contexts relate to legitimate system functions, particularly around data collection or health monitoring. But abnormal frequency or context of ""rename"" and ""create"" operations might suggest malicious or suspicious activity.  ---  *(No directly confirmed malicious activity based solely on this log, but the suspicious pattern warrants further in-depth investigation.)*"
proc_data.json,"Based on the provided log data, the following suspicious activities are identified:"," - Multiple instances of creating temporary files in /Users/mac_malware_research/Library/Biome/tmp and renaming files in /Users/mac_malware_research/Library/Biome/compute/sessions which are associated with a framework called BiomeStreams.framework/Support/BiomeAgent, a known legitimate macOS binary but being repeatedly invoked with new temporary files. - Repetitive file creation and renaming patterns, especially involving temporary and session files, can indicate attempts to obfuscate malicious activity or persistence mechanisms. - The consistent usage of a known system binary (com.apple.*) with same code signature, but in conjunction with suspicious temporary file manipulations, warrants further investigation.  However, no direct execution of known malware or unsigned/unusual binaries is observed in this segment. The main point of concern is the correlation of file operations with an unstandardized directory structure and multiple temporary file creations, which are common in malware TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), specifically for persistence or data exfiltration.

proc_data.json,Below are the suspicious activities identified from the provided log data:," - Multiple instances of `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/BiomeStreams.framework/Support/BiomeAgent` execution with consistent code signing (`com.apple.BiomeAgent`) but unusual repeated mappings and file operations in temp directories and app-specific folders, indicating suspected malicious activity (e.g., repeated create/rename events, temp file manipulations, and multiple memory maps).  - Specifically, the repeated creation and renaming of numerous temporary files in directories unrelated to typical system operation (e.g., `/Users/mac_malware_research/Library/Biome/tmp/`, `/Users/mac_malware_research/Library/Biome/compute/`, `bookmarks/`) combined with consistent code signature and support paths—common tactics to evade detection.  - Unusual renaming of files in app-specific directories (e.g., `com.apple.proactived/FocusModes.WorkMode`, `FocusModes.GamingMode`, `FocusModes.ReadingMode`) after processes in `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/BiomeStreams.framework/Support/BiomeAgent` suggest potentially malicious mechanisms mimicking legitimate services or bypassing sandboxing.  - The presence of `/usr/sbin/cfprefsd`, a legitimate macOS service, but here it's involved in create/rename activities with suspicious temporary files, indicating a possible misuse.  All activities revolve around repeated execution, memory mapping, and file operations involving support and temp directories for a process signing as `com.apple.BiomeAgent`. The pattern suggests covert or malicious behavior disguising as system components.  **Note:** The consistent code signature (""com.apple.BiomeAgent"") with suspicious file operations in temp and user directories should be further investigated. This could be malware masquerading as a legit system support component.  ---  **Output CSV:**  ```csv ActivityType,ProcessPath,EventType,Timestamp,Details Suspicious, /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/BiomeStreams.framework/Support/BiomeAgent,20,2024-04-18T19:39:55.001,Repeated execution and file manipulations in temp and app support directories with consistent code signature.
